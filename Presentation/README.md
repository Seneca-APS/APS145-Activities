# Presentation

## Introduction

The presentation is an opportunity for you to apply your communication skills to SELL your solution, idea, or concept to a targeted audience. In this industry you must learn how to express your ideas and sell your concepts to all types of persons (co-workers, management, clients, etc.).

The presentation will be based on **your selection of ONE** of the **last three activities (8-10)**. This is an individual assignment. You have complete freedom to be as creative as possible in what you envision as a good solution to the activity you choose to base your presentation on. 

> [!TIP]
>
> The presentation has nothing to do with the actual solution your completed for the chosen activity. This presentation should be reflective of what you now see possible as a solution to that chosen activity now that you have some insight on that content and subject matter. 

Below are sections providing the detailed requirements, grading rubric used to evaluate your submission, and the instructions for submitting your presentation.

## Requirements

Based on your selection of **ONE** of the last three activities, create a short **infomercial** (commercial advertisement) directed at a specific targeted audience you are selling your solution to. Your presentation should adhere to the following minimum requirements (for a good grade):

- Target **5 minutes** in length (see grading rubric below for the grade impact tolerances).

- **Your person (shoulders and up) MUST be visible at ALL TIMES** in a small rectangle at one of the corners of the screen to provide authentic proof of delivery (see grading rubric below for grade impact!)

- Properly identify the problem, solution, and the audience it is intended for.

- The majority of the grade is based on a **demonstration of the envisioned solution**. 
    * You are not to actually "code" a solution (this is not a course on coding), but you **must provide simulated mocked screenshots of the application you envision**.
    * Failure to provide this demonstration will result in a VERY low grade (see grading rubric below).

- Include the major workflows (scenario’s) in your demonstration to prove the usability and effectiveness of your solution

- NEVER explain HOW things work – but **DO demonstrate WHAT the solution does**.

- NEVER include pseudocode, flowcharts, or programming source code. 
    * Communication used in your presentation MUST be non-technical so it is easily understood by everyone.

- Engage the audience! It is your job to entice your audience to only want your solution so you will have to work for it (ie: prove it with your demonstration). Simply stating that "your solution is the only one and the best" is meaningless without proof of concept!

- Review the below grading rubric - this is how your presentation will be graded so be sure to address all the requirements!

## Submission

The presentation assessment will be made available to you on Blackboard at the beginning of the week it is due in Week-13 (it will be in the main content area as an item on its own).

The Blackboard instructions will state the following:

---

Do not post the video file! It is too large for the system to reliably manage. Only enter the **LINK** to your video presentation file.

- It is highly recommended you create your presentation in a **.MP4 video file format** as this is the most portable format and **ensures all professors will be able to view it properly**, otherwise you run the risk of your work **not being accessible and therefore not gradable**.

- It is your responsibility to **ensure your professor has sufficient security privileges to access and view your video presentation file**.

- It is advised you store your presentation on your **Seneca** Office 365 **OneDrive**.
