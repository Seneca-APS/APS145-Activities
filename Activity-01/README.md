# APS145 - Applied Problem Solving

# Activity-1 (2.5%)

# Submission Instructions

At the start of class your professor will provide you with a worksheet for you to write your answers to the activity questions.

At the end of class, you must submit your worksheet for grading (see the [grading rubric](./README.md#rubric) at the end of this page).

> [!CAUTION]
>
> **Worksheets will NOT be accepted after the end of class and no online submissions will be allowed**. 
> 
> This is an interactive class and **requires attendance** - if you are not present to actively work on the activity questions and participate in the discussions, you will not receive marks for the activity.

# Introduction

These activities are focused on the following:

* Applying [data recognition](https://seneca-scpa.github.io/Applied-Problem-Solving/computational-thinking#data-representation): Identifying the important information from the problem
* Creating [variables](https://seneca-scpa.github.io/Applied-Problem-Solving/variables) for the identified important information
* Time "constants" for accessing current date and time information
* Applying [decomposition](https://seneca-scpa.github.io/Applied-Problem-Solving/computational-thinking#decomposition) to identify the needed logic to solve the problem (Q-4 and Q-5)
* Creating solutions that include user input and displaying output (Q-4 and Q-5)
* Creating flowchart solutions
* Creating pseudocode solutions

Take a moment to review the course notes on these topics

# [Computational Thinking](https://seneca-scpa.github.io/Applied-Problem-Solving/computational-thinking)

The below questions involve the application of:
* Understanding the problem
* Decomposition
* Data Representation
* Algorithm

---

# Question-1

An application is needed to get user input for a 4-digit year value which will later be used in displaying the title "Seneca YYYY" where the [YYYY] will be the year variable's value. Identify the variable required for this problem. Focusing only on the data (not the process), how would the variable be documented in both pseudocode and flowchart forms?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your professor will lead a discussion on your solutions and review potential answers. This is a good chance to evaluate with feedback on what makes a poor solution from a good solution. If you have questions, this is the time to ask and explore - **don't hold back!**
>

# Question-2

**Preface**

It is common for programmers to access the **current** date and time information in solutions. You will need to refer to the keyword "`NOW`" to access the different attributes of the date and time parts. Here is how you would access these parts:

|Date/Time Part | Result |
| ----- | ----- |
|`NOW` | 2025-06-01 23:59:59 |
|`NOW::Date` | 2025-06-01 |
|`NOW::Time` | 23:59:59 |
|`NOW::Year` | 2025 |
|`NOW::Month` | 06 |
|`NOW::Day` | 01 |
|`NOW::Hour` | 23 |
|`NOW::Minute` | 59 |
|`NOW::Second` | 59 |

> [!TIP]
>
> Depending on the context and for simplification, the Month and Day parts can either be the numerical or alpha representations.

**Problem Question**

An application is needed to display the current 4-digit year as a title "Seneca YYYY" (where the [YYYY] is a predetermined year value using a variable). Identify the variable required for this problem. Focusing only on the data (not the process), how would the variable be documented in both pseudocode and flowchart forms?

# Question-3

An application is needed to display the current 4-digit year, month, and day as a title "Seneca M D, YYYY". All these values are stored to variables (where the [YYYY] is a predetermined value, and the [M]onth and [D]ay are user-entered values). Identify the variables required for this problem. Focusing only on the data (not the process), how would the variables be documented in both pseudocode and flowchart forms?

# Question-4

Continuing the previous question, now add the sequential steps for fully describing how the user would be prompted for the inputs and the displaying of the title. Document a flowchart overview of this process and a detailed pseudocode for this problem.

> [!TIP]
>
> 1. The flowchart no longer requires variables.
>
> 2. The flowchart will be greatly simplified now that it can **refer to the detailed pseudocode function** which will fully describe the process.
>
> 3. The pseudocode details should represent a function with the name `ShowTitle`.

# Question-5

An application is needed to collect Seneca student application information. The initial version of the application prompts a single user for their application information which should include the following details:

* Student name
* Date of birth
* Residency Information (ex: **DOM** for domestic or **INT** for international)
* Starting term (ex: **Fall** or **Winter** or **Summer**)
* Program Code (ex: **CPP** or **CPA**)
* Choice number (ex: **1** or **2** or **3**)

After getting this user-input information, the application should display the all the data to confirm the information was stored to variables successfully.

Document a flowchart overview of this process and a detailed pseudocode for this problem. The pseudocode part should represent a function named `GetApplicationInfo`.

Review the following example execution of the logic if it were to be coded as an application and match this logic in your answer.

```
Please enter the following information...

First name: Jiminy
Last name : Cricket
Birthdate YEAR : 2005
Birthdate MONTH: 11
Birthdate DAY  : 20
Residency: INT
Program Start Term: Fall
Program Code: CPA
Program Choice: 1

Testing data entered...

Application Date: 2025-09-24
Student Name    : Cricket, Jiminy
Birthdate       : 2005-11-20
Residency       : INT
Term Start      : Fall
Program Code    : CPA
Program Choice  : 1

```
