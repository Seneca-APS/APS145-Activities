## Submission Instructions

At the start of class your professor will provide you with a worksheet for you to write your answers to the activity questions.

At the end of class, you must submit your worksheet for grading (see the [grading rubric](./README.md#rubric) at the end of this page).

**Worksheets will NOT be accepted after the end of class and no online submissions will be allowed**. 

This is an interactive class and requires attendance - if you are not present to actively work on the activity questions and participate in the discussions, you will not receive marks for the activity.
